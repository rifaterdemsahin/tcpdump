h1. README: Retrieving Data from a Pod in OpenShift

This README provides instructions on how to retrieve specific data from a pod running in an OpenShift environment. The example focuses on fetching network interface details from within a pod, demonstrating the use of standard Linux commands for system inspection.

h2. Overview

This guide explains how to access and retrieve data from a pod in OpenShift. Specifically, it demonstrates how to check the link index of the *eth0* network interface inside a pod. This information can be useful for network troubleshooting and understanding the network configuration of your pod.

h2. Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster and the *oc* CLI tool installed on your local machine.
- Necessary permissions to log in to the OpenShift cluster and access the desired pod.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line interface and OpenShift commands.

h2. Step-by-Step Instructions

h3. 1. Log into the OpenShift Cluster

Before accessing the pod, ensure you are logged into the OpenShift cluster using the *oc* command.

{code:bash}
oc login --token=<your_token> --server=https://<your_openshift_server>:<port>
{code}

Replace *<your_token>* with your actual OpenShift login token, and *<your_openshift_server>:<port>* with the OpenShift server URL and port.

h3. 2. Access the Pod

To access the shell of the desired pod, use the following command:

{code:bash}
oc rsh <pod_name>
{code}

Replace *<pod_name>* with the name of your target pod. This command opens a remote shell session in the specified pod.

h3. 3. Retrieve Network Interface Information

Once inside the pod's shell, you can retrieve information about its network interfaces. To get the link index of the *eth0* interface, run:

{code:bash}
cat /sys/class/net/eth0/iflink
{code}

*Output:*

{noformat}
42
{noformat}

*Explanation:*

- The *cat* command reads the contents of the */sys/class/net/eth0/iflink* file.
- The output (*42* in this case) represents the link index of the *eth0* network interface. This value is used internally by the kernel to manage the network interface.

h2. Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the pod and execute commands.
- If you are unable to see any output or encounter permission issues, verify your access rights and ensure the pod is running.

By following these instructions, you can retrieve specific data from a pod in an OpenShift environment, which can be essential for network diagnostics and system administration tasks.
